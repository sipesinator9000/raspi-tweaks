This repo is a suite of tweaks and testing tools that I find very useful when setting up new Retropie builds.
The wiki section also contains a guide on how to tweak your RetroPie to reflect how I like to have mine set up.
The guide assumes you are using a Raspberry Pi 3B+ and a RetroFlag NesPi+ case. Very specific, I know, but I think this combination provides the best value for money for building a retro game emulator without spending an absolute fortune on hardware.
